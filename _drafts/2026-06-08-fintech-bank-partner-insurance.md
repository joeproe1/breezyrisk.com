Before a bank partner will let a FinTech touch its infrastructure, it mandates insurance. Tech E&O at specific limits. Cyber liability with defined sub-coverages. Crime or fidelity coverage. Additional Insured status. These requirements are spelled out in the partnership agreement, usually in a section nobody reads after the deal closes.

These requirements are non-negotiable. They are also, in most cases, unverified. The bank checks the certificate of insurance.

Nobody checks the policy language behind it.

## A Certificate Is Not a Policy

A certificate of insurance confirms three things: a policy exists, it is active, and it carries certain limits. That is all it does.

A bank partner agreement says something more specific. It doesn't just require "$5 million in cyber liability." It requires "coverage for unauthorized access to computer systems, data breach notification and response costs, regulatory fines and penalties, business interruption from system outages, and social engineering fraud". Whether the policy behind the certificate actually delivers all of those things is a question the certificate doesn't answer.

The certificate says $5M cyber liability. The partnership agreement lists twelve specific coverage requirements across four policy types. Nobody confirms the policy does what the contract requires.

## The Paper Shield

I call this gap **The Paper Shield**: a FinTech's insurance program satisfies the bank partner's requirements on paper but not in the policy language.

The most common version: the bank partner contract requires both Cyber and Crime coverage. The FinTech has a cyber policy at $5 million. It doesn't have a standalone crime policy.

This matters because cyber insurance and crime insurance cover different losses.

</div>

A FinTech needs both policies. Many carry only cyber. The bank partner contract technically requires crime coverage, but the bank sees $5 million on the certificate and reads "cyber" as "everything digital."

A FinTech with a $5 million cyber policy and no crime coverage is technically non-compliant with a bank partner agreement that specifies both. In practice, nobody catches this because the certificate doesn't break coverage into those categories. It lists a policy type and a limit. The bank's compliance team checks the box and moves on.

This is one facet of a larger structural problem in FinTech insurance, where programs get assembled from mismatched pieces. See [The FinTech Identity Crisis Nobody Is Solving]({{ '/insights/fintech-identity-crisis/' | relative_url }}).

That level of scrutiny is changing.

## What Changed After Synapse

In 2024, Synapse Financial Technologies, a San Francisco-based banking-as-a-service middleware company, filed for bankruptcy. Synapse sat between FinTechs and their bank partners, holding the ledger that tracked which customer funds belonged to whom. When it collapsed, approximately $265 million in customer funds were frozen because Synapse's records couldn't be reconciled against those of its primary bank partner, Evolve. The Federal Reserve issued a consent order against Evolve for "unsafe and unsound banking practices" in managing its FinTech partnerships.

The practical effect on FinTechs: bank partners ratcheted up insurance requirements. Partnership agreements that previously required $1 million in cyber coverage now require $3 million to $5 million across multiple coverage types, with specific sub-coverage mandates. FinTechs that were grandfathered under older, lighter requirements are being asked to re-certify.

For the first time, some bank compliance teams are looking past the certificate and asking to see the actual policy forms. They want to verify that the coverage types specified in the partnership agreement exist as defined coverages in the policy, not just as line items on a certificate.

## "Additional Insured" Doesn't Mean What You Think

Bank partner contracts often require the FinTech to name the bank as an "Additional Insured" on its Tech E&O and cyber policies. The assumption: this gives the bank its own coverage under the FinTech's policy if a claim arises from the partnership.

The reality is messier. Many Tech E&O policies don't offer Additional Insured endorsements at all. When the endorsement is available, it may only cover the bank for claims arising from the FinTech's professional services, not for regulatory investigations, data breach liabilities, or the bank's own defense costs. And in most cases, nobody tests whether the endorsement on the specific policy form actually delivers the protection the bank's contract expects.

Both parties think they are protected. The bank assumes the endorsement gives it coverage. The FinTech assumes compliance because the broker added something to the policy. Whether it works is a question nobody asks until a claim forces the answer.

"Additional Insured" on the certificate doesn't mean the bank is protected. It means an endorsement exists. Whether that endorsement works is a separate question.

## What You Should Be Able to Answer

These are questions you should be able to answer about your own insurance program before your bank partner asks them.

<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.5; color: #0A2540;">Bank partners don't audit your insurance, they audit your certificate.
