**This is a real-world scenario about how proper Tech E&O coverage turned a $350,000 claim into a $25,000 deductible, and what most cybersecurity consultants miss.**

## The Setup

A 12-person penetration testing firm in Pennsylvania, let's call the firm "SecureTest," had what looked like a routine engagement: A regional healthcare provider hired them to conduct external and internal network penetration testing ahead of a planned $2M system upgrade.

Whether you're a cybersecurity consultant, pentesting firm, or MSSP, this scenario happens more often than you think.

The scope was clear. The 3-week timeline was reasonable. The $45,000 contract was signed.

Then everything went sideways.

## What Went Wrong

During the internal network assessment, SecureTest's senior consultant escalated privileges on a domain controller to demonstrate a critical vulnerability, standard practice in pentesting.

Except this specific domain controller also managed the client's production patient scheduling system. The exploitation triggered a cascading authentication failure that took the healthcare provider's scheduling system offline for 24 hours.

> **The Damage:**
>
> - 847 appointments manually rescheduled
> - 12-hour shifts for administrative staff
> - Dozens of patients waiting 2+ hours in lobbies
> - Physicians sitting idle while the practice hemorrhaged revenue
> - Emergency IT contractors billing $15,000 to restore services

Three weeks later, the healthcare provider sent a demand letter to SecureTest claiming **$350,000 in damages**.

## What Most Firms Get Wrong

Here's where a typical mid-sized penetration testing firm would face an existential crisis.

Their standard Tech E&O policy wouldn't cover this **penetration testing insurance claim**.

Why? Because of the **"technology services performed" exclusion**, the silent killer in most tech E&O policies. I covered this exclusion problem in detail in my article on [Tech E&O policy exclusions]({{ '/insights/your-tech-eo-policy-probably-excludes-the-services-you-actually-provide/' | relative_url }}). Most cybersecurity consultants don't discover these gaps until it's too late.

Here's what this exclusion typically says: *"We will not cover claims arising from hands-on technology services, including but not limited to: system testing, configuration, implementation, or modification of computer systems."*

**Read that again.** If your policy has this language, it excludes your entire business model.

### Most firms also make these mistakes:

- Assuming their Cyber policy covers professional negligence (it doesn't. Cyber policies cover data breaches, not errors in performing security testing)
- Not realizing that "property damage" exclusions can apply to taking down production systems
- Having defense costs that erode their policy limits instead of being paid separately

That last point is critical. Even if you think you have coverage, inadequate limits can leave you exposed. At $400-600/hour for cyber-specialized defense counsel, you're burning through $50,000 in legal fees before you even get to settlement discussions.

> **Does Your Policy Have These Coverage Killers?**
>
> - "Technology services performed" exclusion
> - "Property damage" exclusion with no carve-back for electronic data
> - Cyber policy as your only coverage
> - Defense costs that erode your limits

## What SecureTest Did Right

SecureTest had one critical thing in their favor: Their broker had negotiated removal of the "technology services performed" exclusion.

> Their policy explicitly included an endorsement stating: **"Coverage applies to professional services including penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, red team exercises, and security testing that may result in system disruption or temporary service interruption when performed in accordance with industry standards."**

This single endorsement meant the difference between coverage and catastrophe.

### They also had:

- A policy specifically underwritten for hands-on security testing (not generic IT consulting)
- Defense costs paid in addition to their $2M limit, not eroding it

## How It Played Out

SecureTest reported the claim within 48 hours. Their carrier:

- Assigned experienced defense counsel specializing in technology E&O
- Reviewed engagement documents and technical logs
- Opened settlement negotiations within 45 days

The defense counsel identified key factors strengthening SecureTest's position:

- Proper scope documentation and client sign-off
- Evidence the client failed to maintain separate test and production environments as specified
- Technical logs showing industry-standard practices were followed

After three months, the claim settled for $125,000, covered entirely by the E&O policy.

> **The Math:**
>
> - Total out-of-pocket for SecureTest: **$25,000**
> - Total exposure without proper coverage: **$400,000+**
> - Difference: **$375,000**
>
> *That's roughly 20x this firm's annual insurance premium.*

## The Bottom Line

SecureTest survived because they had proper coverage in place before the engagement started.

Most penetration testing firms don't. They're operating with generic tech E&O policies written for software developers or IT consultants, not for firms whose entire service offering involves deliberately attacking client systems.

**The difference between the right coverage and the wrong coverage isn't theoretical. It's $375,000.**

*Disclaimer: This scenario is based on actual claim patterns in the cybersecurity services sector. While details have been modified for confidentiality, the coverage issues and policy exclusions discussed represent real gaps we've identified through policy reviews and industry research.*
