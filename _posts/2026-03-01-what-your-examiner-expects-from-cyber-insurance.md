The exam question has changed. It used to be: "Do you have cyber insurance?" Most banks could answer that one. Check the box, show the declarations page, move on.

Now the question is different: "How do you know your cyber insurance is adequate?"

Most banks cannot answer that. Not because they lack coverage, but because nobody has read the policy language against the bank's actual operations. The declarations page shows limits and a premium. It does not show what is excluded, what conditions must be met for coverage to apply, or how the cyber policy interacts with the fidelity bond and D&O sitting next to it.

I review insurance policies for community banks and credit unions. The gap between what banks think they have and what the policy actually says is where examiner findings come from.

## What Examiners Are Looking For

The FFIEC (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) IT Examination Handbook treats cyber insurance as a component of the bank's information security program, not a standalone checkbox. In practice, examiners want to see four things:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 16px; margin: 24px 0;">

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #3B82F6; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(59,130,246,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>Board-level review of coverage, not just approval of the premium.</strong> The Board should be able to articulate what the cyber policy covers and does not cover. "Our broker recommended this policy and the premium is $X" is not a review. That is a rubber stamp.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #3B82F6; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(59,130,246,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>Limits that align with the bank's risk profile.</strong> A $1M cyber policy for a bank with $500M in assets and 50,000 customer records raises questions. Examiners expect the bank to have documented how coverage limits were determined, based on its own risk assessment.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #3B82F6; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(59,130,246,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>Security warranty compliance.</strong> This is the one most banks miss entirely. Covered in the next section, because it is where the real exposure sits.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #3B82F6; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(59,130,246,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>Understanding of how cyber, fidelity bond, and D&O interact.</strong> A ransomware attack that leads to a wire transfer loss, followed by a regulatory investigation into Board oversight, touches all three policies. Examiners want to know which policy responds to which part.

</div>

Examiners are not auditing policy language themselves. Not yet. But they expect the bank to have done that work.

## The Security Warranty Problem

Every cyber policy I review for banks contains security warranty requirements. The carrier requires specific controls as conditions of coverage: multi-factor authentication on all remote access, endpoint detection and response, a defined patching cadence, encrypted and tested backups.

These are not suggestions. They are coverage conditions. If the bank's IT environment does not match what the policy requires, the carrier can deny a claim or rescind coverage after a loss.

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #DC2626; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(220,38,38,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 24px 0;">
<strong>The missing cross-check:</strong> Your examiner asks about controls. Your IT auditor tests controls. Your carrier requires controls. Nobody checks whether these three lists match.<br><br>
<strong>A bank can pass its IT audit, satisfy its examiner, and still violate a policy warranty it did not know existed.</strong>
</div>

Fixing this requires someone to sit down with the policy and the IT audit findings in the same room. That almost never happens.

## Three Things to Prepare Before Your Next Exam

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #00D4AA; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(0,212,170,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 24px 0;">
<strong>1. Match your policy warranties to your IT audit.</strong><br>
Pull your carrier's security warranty requirements. Compare every required control to your most recent IT audit findings. Where they do not match, you have a gap that needs fixing before a claim, not after.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #00D4AA; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(0,212,170,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 24px 0;">
<strong>2. Create a one-page coverage summary for the Board.</strong><br>
What your policy covers, key sublimits, major exclusions. One page. Plain language. Updated at renewal. When the examiner asks whether the Board reviewed coverage, this is your answer.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #00D4AA; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(0,212,170,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 24px 0;">
<strong>3. Map your three policies against your most likely incidents.</strong><br>
Ransomware, wire fraud, vendor breach, data breach, regulatory investigation. For each, document which policy responds (cyber, fidelity bond, D&O). Where a scenario falls between two policies, that is the gap to address.
</div>

## Where This Leads

Most community banks are not prepared for these questions. The fidelity bond alone runs 30 pages before riders. Expecting a compliance officer to cross-reference three policies from three carriers is unrealistic without help.

This is what the [Risk Intelligence Report]({{ '/risk-intelligence-report/' | relative_url }}) is designed to do: read your cyber policy, fidelity bond, and D&O side by side, map how they interact against real incident scenarios, flag the security warranty gaps, and produce a Board-ready report that answers the examiner's question before they ask it.
