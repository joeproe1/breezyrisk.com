*Is parametric the right tool for supply chain business interruption, or a hammer looking for a nail?*

On February 3, 2023, MKS Instruments, a critical upstream supplier of RF power generators, vacuum components, and flow controllers to the global semiconductor equipment industry, was hit by a ransomware attack that shut down two of its three operating divisions.

The documented financial impact:

<div style="font-size: 14px; color: #6B7B8D; margin-top: 8px; line-height: 1.4;">Combined known losses<br>from a single supplier</div>
</div>
</div>

Applied Materials disclosed the $250 million impact in an SEC filing that referred only to "a cybersecurity event recently announced by one of our suppliers." Additional losses at other major customers were never disclosed publicly.

Traditional business interruption insurance covered the downstream supply chain losses at zero dollars. Not reduced. Not disputed. Not delayed. Zero. The policies were never designed for this scenario.

The instinct is to say "parametric insurance could have solved this." But before reaching for that conclusion, it's worth asking whether we are starting from the problem or starting from the product.

## Why traditional business interruption insurance doesn't cover this

Traditional business interruption coverage requires a "covered peril," typically a physical loss or damage, at the insured's own premises disrupting the insured's own operations. A ransomware attack on your supplier's facility doesn't meet that requirement. Your factory is running. Your equipment is fine. The problem is that the components you need aren't arriving.

Contingent business interruption extensions do exist. They extend coverage to disruptions at named suppliers or customers. But most still require physical damage at the supplier's location. A ransomware attack, an export ban, a sanctions listing, a rare earth supply restriction, a shipping chokepoint closure: none of these are physical damage. They are the actual exposures driving supply chain disruption in the semiconductor industry, and they fall outside what traditional business interruption was built to cover.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #00D4AA; padding: 24px 28px; background: rgba(0, 212, 170, 0.06); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 40px 0;">
<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.5; color: #0A2540;">Our insurance architecture was built for fires and hurricanes.<br><br>Actual risk exposures are ransomware, rare earth export bans, and single-source dependencies. The mismatch is structural, not a product configuration problem.</div>
</div>

This isn't a theoretical gap. Lloyd's and Willis Towers Watson published a report in 2023, ["Loose Connections,"](https://assets.lloyds.com/media/b8c2cc60-24d7-45d2-b92b-782c161dd7c4/LloydsFutureset_LooseConnections_ExecutiveSummary_PartOne.pdf) that surveyed the semiconductor supply chain specifically. 52% of semiconductor companies considered supply chain insurance "mission critical." 81% cited lack of access to insurance solutions as a top challenge. The demand exists. The products don't.

The CHIPS and Science Act invested $52 billion in domestic semiconductor fabrication capacity. The upstream supply chain feeding those fabs, fewer than 20 major suppliers serving the entire equipment industry, remains concentrated, fragile, and functionally uninsured against the disruptions most likely to occur.

## The design constraints

Before building the case for parametric, it's worth understanding where naive implementations would fail. Not as a reason to abandon the approach, but to define the constraints any viable product must meet.

**Basis risk is severe in supply chains.** Parametric works well for weather because the relationship between trigger and loss is tight: wind speed correlates with property damage, rainfall correlates with crop loss. Supply chain disruption doesn't have that characteristic. A cyberattack or an export ban produce fundamentally different loss patterns at different speeds with different recovery trajectories. Mapping these heterogeneous events to a common trigger that reliably correlates with downstream financial loss is an unsolved engineering problem, not a product configuration problem.

In [Fast Money, Slow Trust](/insights/fast-money-slow-trust/), I wrote about basis risk, oracle risk, and the coordination problem in parametric insurance more broadly. Every one of those concerns applies with extra force for supply chain risks, because the trigger-to-loss relationship in supply chains is weaker than in weather or natural catastrophe.

**Many supply chain losses are temporary.** Applied Materials disclosed a $250 million revenue impact from the MKS disruption. But the company recovered most of that shortfall the following quarter. The loss was delayed revenue, not destroyed value. A parametric product that pays a fixed amount on a loss that resolves itself creates a windfall, not insurance. Speed of payout is less compelling when the insured's revenue bounces back on its own timeline.

**Event scarcity means you can't calibrate properly.** Hurricane triggers draw on decades of data across thousands of events. Major semiconductor supply chain disruptions with publicly quantified downstream losses number in the tens, not thousands. That sample size doesn't support a pricing model. It supports a guess.

These aren't minor objections. They define the design constraints that any viable parametric product for supply chain risk must address.

## What else could work

The default answer today is to not insure supply chain disruption at all. Most semiconductor companies have made that choice, and it isn't irrational. The available products don't match the exposures. The premiums for what coverage does exist don't reflect the value delivered. "Do nothing" is a market signal that the existing insurance products aren't good enough.

Two alternatives to parametric deserve a direct hearing.

<div style="background: #f8faf9; border-radius: 10px; padding: 28px 32px; margin: 24px 0;">
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">1</div>
<div><strong>Broader indemnity design.</strong> Expand contingent business interruption endorsements to cover non-physical upstream disruption: cyberattacks at named suppliers, regulatory actions, production halts regardless of cause. Loss-matched, so no basis risk.<br><br>The barrier is adjustment complexity. When one supplier disruption cascades through multiple downstream companies, proving each company's attributable loss becomes a multi-party exercise that could take years. That difficulty explains why no one has built this product.</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">2</div>
<div><strong>Contingent capital.</strong> Pre-arranged credit lines triggered by supply chain events. No basis risk because there's no fixed payout to mismatch. The company borrows during the disruption, repays when revenue recovers. For temporary losses like MKS, where revenue bounced back in a quarter, this may be more efficient than insurance. It solves the cash flow problem without the basis risk problem.</div>
</div>
</div>

Both are viable. Neither is a complete answer. The point I want to make is that parametric isn't the only available tool, and each tool covers a different slice of the problem.

## Where the alternatives fall short

Having given the alternatives a fair hearing: they each break in specific, predictable ways.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 20px; margin: 24px 0;">
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #3B82F6; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(59,130,246,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>Broader indemnity</strong> works when the loss is adjustable. For a single supplier disruption like the 2023 ransomware incident, it probably is, given enough time and enough lawyers. For a cascading event hitting multiple supply chain nodes simultaneously, the adjustment becomes a multi-year exercise. The insured gets paid in 2028 for a disruption in 2026. If the purpose of insurance is to provide capital when the insured needs it, that timeline defeats the purpose.
</div>
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #F59E0B; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(245,158,11,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>Contingent capital</strong> solves cash flow but doesn't transfer risk. The company still absorbs the loss. For a $250 million revenue hit that recovers in one quarter, that is manageable. For a permanent supply source loss, where a critical single-site manufacturer suffers a facility destruction or an export ban removes a material source with no replacement, contingent capital is a loan against a hole that doesn't fill.
</div>
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #DC2626; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(220,38,38,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>"Do nothing"</strong> works until it doesn't. Most companies that carry no supply chain coverage have never experienced a major disruption. The 2023 incident hit one supplier and generated $450 million in documented losses. A correlated event, even a moderate earthquake in a region where several critical suppliers share a cluster, or a rare earth export ban affecting the entire industry simultaneously, would generate losses an order of magnitude larger.
</div>
</div>

## Where parametric fits

If the question is whether parametric insurance solves supply chain business interruption, the honest answer is: not as a general-purpose tool. But for a specific class of supply chain disruptions, parametric is the right approach, and the semiconductor supply chain is the right place to prove it.

It starts with the baseline.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #00D4AA; padding: 24px 28px; background: rgba(0, 212, 170, 0.06); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 40px 0;">
<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.5; color: #0A2540;">Currently, downstream insurance coverage for semiconductor supply chain disruption is zero. The question is not "parametric vs. a better indemnity product", it's "parametric vs. nothing".</div>
</div>

$100 million in parametric payout on a $250 million loss is 40% coverage with 60% basis risk. That isn't good. But $100 million is $100 million more than the downstream companies received from their insurance programs. On an absolute basis, the product has problems. Against the actual alternative, it has value.

That baseline alone doesn't justify the product. Three additional conditions identify where parametric is the right tool:

<div style="background: #f8faf9; border-radius: 10px; padding: 28px 32px; margin: 24px 0;">
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">1</div>
<div><strong>The loss is non-recoverable or slow-recovering.</strong> Not delayed revenue that bounces back in a quarter, but production capacity lost for months or permanently. A facility destruction at a single-site manufacturer. A permanent export restriction removing a material source. A supplier failure with no alternative source. Speed of payout matters because the loss doesn't resolve itself.</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">2</div>
<div><strong>The trigger is tied to indisputable public data.</strong> SEC 8-K filings create a legally mandated, timestamped record when a public company experiences a material disruption. Most major semiconductor equipment suppliers are publicly traded, so these obligations apply across the critical nodes of the supply chain. SEC filings, seismic data, and official government declarations are all public, objective, and legally reliable. This is not the oracle risk problem. This is legal disclosure.</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">3</div>
<div><strong>The insured needs capital during the disruption, not after it.</strong> Traditional claims take up to 18 months to settle. Broader indemnity, even if it existed, would face the same adjustment timeline for cascading supply chain losses. Parametric pays when the trigger fires. For a company facing immediate production shortfalls and contractual penalties, the difference between capital in a week and capital in a year is the difference between operational continuity and financial distress.</div>
</div>
</div>

Where all three conditions hold alongside the zero-coverage baseline, parametric has a defensible role that the alternatives cannot fill. Where they don't all hold, one of the other tools is probably better.

## The research agenda

The product doesn't exist yet. Building it requires research that addresses three specific challenges.

Someone needs to build the trigger infrastructure: a validated mapping from public-data events to expected downstream losses, with quantified basis risk. That mapping doesn't exist today. The 2023 ransomware incident proves it is plausible for a single event. Whether it generalizes across disruption types, across the sparse population of documented events, is an open research question.

The trigger must solve the attribution problem. When a downstream company's revenue drops, how much of that drop is caused by the upstream supply chain event and how much by demand cycles, pricing shifts, or unrelated operational issues? Isolating the signal from the noise is a causal inference problem, not a monitoring problem.

The product must be layered with indemnity, not sold as standalone coverage. Parametric covers the immediate cash need while traditional business interruption or an expanded contingent business interruption endorsement works through the adjustment process. The coordination problem I described in [Fast Money, Slow Trust](/insights/fast-money-slow-trust/) must be solved at the product design stage, not discovered at claim time.

And the semiconductor supply chain is the right place to prove it. Fewer than 20 major upstream suppliers. Almost all are US-listed public companies with SEC filing obligations. The dependency graph is bounded and knowable. Geographic concentration in identifiable clusters. Critical material dependencies that are well-documented. If a public-data parametric trigger can be validated anywhere, this supply chain is the place to start.

## Starting from the problem

The insurance industry's instinct when it sees an uninsured risk is to reach for the nearest product. Parametric is that product right now because it's new and flexible and attracting capital. But "new and flexible" isn't the same as "right."

For supply chain business interruption, the honest answer is that no single tool solves the whole problem. Broader indemnity design, contingent capital, and parametric triggers each cover different slices. The value is in knowing which slice is which, and in being honest about which slices remain uncovered.

The semiconductor supply chain has a $450 million proof point that the current approach — which is no approach at all — doesn't work. What replaces it should start from the problem, not from whichever product happens to be raising capital.
