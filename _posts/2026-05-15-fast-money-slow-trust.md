*A practitioner's perspective on a market growing faster than confidence.*

The parametric insurance market has passed $20 billion in premium by most market estimates and is growing at double digits. New MGAs are launching, brokers are adding parametric desks, reinsurance capacity is flowing in, and every conference panel says the same optimistic thing.

<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.5; color: #0A2540;">The capital is pouring in. The honest conversation about where the model breaks isn't keeping pace.</div>
</div>

Parametric insurance has a strong value proposition. But the gap between what the product promises and what buyers actually understand hasn't closed, and that disconnect deserves more attention than it's getting.

I spent more than 20 years on the carrier and MGA side before I started the independent audit work I do now. That included operations and strategy roles at the carrier level, and co-founding and running a parametric MGA. That last part is why this series exists. I've watched this product work, and I've watched it fail to reach the people it was built for.

## Where parametric works

Parametric solves problems that traditional indemnity insurance has struggled with for decades.

A hurricane makes landfall and tears through a coastal community. A parametric policy pays within a few days based on measured wind speed. No adjuster. No dispute over what counts as covered damage. Cash arrives in the policyholder's account while the indemnity claim is still being filed. For a business facing immediate recovery costs, that speed is the difference between resilience and financial distress.

For agriculture and climate adaptation, parametric reaches exposures the indemnity market can't serve: crop coverage for farmers in regions where indemnity underwriting is uneconomical or unavailable, catastrophe protection where the industry has priced out or pulled back entirely.

The speed of payout, the simplicity of the trigger, and the scalability of the model are genuine advantages. When the trigger correlates tightly with loss and the buyer understands what they're purchasing, parametric works very well.

Those conditions don't always hold.

## Where the model breaks: basis risk

Basis risk is the term everyone in the parametric market uses and few buyers fully understand.

The concept is straightforward. A parametric product pays based on a trigger event, say a wind speed threshold being crossed, not based on actual loss, like a destroyed roof. When the trigger lines up with the loss, the product works. When it doesn't, the buyer has what's called basis risk: either the payout doesn't match the loss, or the trigger isn't met at all and the buyer gets nothing.

Indemnity insurance has its own problems: exclusions, limits, slow claims. But it adjusts against actual loss. Parametric doesn't. That difference, and the education gap around it, are significant in practice. A buyer purchases a wind-speed parametric product expecting it to behave like their indemnity coverage. The hurricane hits their property, but the wind speed at the reference weather station measures 2 mph below the trigger threshold. The product doesn't pay. The damaged roof is real. The coverage doesn't respond, and the buyer has no adjuster to call, no claim to negotiate, nobody to vent to.

Basis risk is quantifiable and manageable through careful trigger calibration. Tighter triggers reduce basis risk but increase premium. Looser triggers are cheaper but create larger gaps between payout and loss. The design and modeling conversation is where most of the real work happens. But that conversation first requires buyers who understand what they're buying, and the market hasn't invested enough in making sure they do.

## Trigger design and oracle risk

If basis risk is the core tension in parametric insurance, trigger design is where that tension gets built into the product.

A parametric trigger is a data-driven condition: wind speed exceeds a threshold, rainfall drops below a level, a commodity price drops below a benchmark. The trigger is the product. Everything depends on the quality of the data source, the integrity of the measurement, and the correlation between what the trigger measures and what the buyer loses.

This creates what's called "oracle risk." The term comes from prediction markets, and the connection is direct: both a parametric trigger and a prediction-market contract depend on a single external data source being honest. If the data source that validates the trigger is wrong, manipulated, or unavailable, the product breaks. In April 2026, someone reportedly used a hair dryer on a temperature sensor at a Paris airport to manipulate Polymarket weather contracts. $34,000 in manipulated winnings at one weather station. It exposed a vulnerability that applies to every parametric trigger built on a single data feed.

The quality gap between triggers is real. Products built on dense US weather station networks with decades of historical records produce reliable triggers. Products built on sparse data, or on novel data sources without long track records, carry trigger risk that compounds the basis risk already inherent in the model. Buyers rarely have the technical background to evaluate trigger quality. Most accept what's offered and discover the limitations at claim time.

## The pairing problem

Where indemnity insurance is unavailable, parametric stands on its own. For example: crop coverage for farmers in regions the indemnity market has never reached, or for crops that fall outside federal insurance programs. Catastrophe protection in markets the industry has abandoned. In those situations, parametric is the product.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #00D4AA; padding: 24px 28px; background: rgba(0, 212, 170, 0.06); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 40px 0;">
<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.5; color: #0A2540;">For commercial property, business interruption, and supply chain risk, where indemnity programs exist, parametric isn't a standalone product. Most of the market hasn't caught up to that fact.</div>
</div>

In commercial lines, parametric works best when paired with indemnity coverage to fill specific gaps. Deductible buydowns, sublimit gap-fills, coverage for risks the indemnity market declines entirely. These are the natural use cases.

But it's common for parametric products to be purchased separately from the indemnity program, sometimes placed by a different team or even a different broker. For example, a buyer carries a commercial property policy with a $500,000 wind deductible and a separate parametric wind product from a different provider. Whether the parametric payout covers that deductible gap depends on trigger correlation nobody has modeled against the indemnity program's terms.

Large brokerages have dedicated parametric desks that operate separately from traditional placement teams. The structure creates a risk: the parametric team sells the product, the indemnity team places the program, and the buyer assumes they have layered coverage. In practice, they may have two disconnected products that don't work together when a loss occurs.

This is a coordination problem the industry is still solving. Until parametric becomes part of the program design conversation rather than a separate product conversation, buyers will continue to carry coverage they believe is coordinated but may not be.

## What I learned building a parametric MGA

In 2020 I co-founded and ran a parametric MGA called Parachute Insurance. We built a hurricane product for residential property owners in Florida: hurricane risk models on the front end, real-time weather triggers, reinsurance capacity out of Bermuda. The promise was simple: fast payouts after a storm, no claims adjustment, no documentation burden for a homeowner still clearing debris off the driveway.

We hit the coordination problem firsthand. Homeowners compared the parametric payout to their total loss, saw the gap, and couldn't make sense of it. The product confused more buyers than it protected.

The hardest part was distribution. Most homeowners don't fully understand their own indemnity policy: the deductibles, the exclusions, what's covered. A lot of them only find out after a loss and a bad claims experience. Asking those same people to also absorb basis risk and trigger mechanics is a conversation that doesn't scale. The product is simple. The purchase decision isn't.

The product worked. Getting it to market didn't. I moved on from Parachute, and the market has grown fast since then. The coordination problem hasn't been solved.

## Five questions before you buy a parametric product

Any buyer evaluating a parametric insurance product should answer five questions before signing.

<div style="background: #f8faf9; border-radius: 10px; padding: 28px 32px; margin: 24px 0;">
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">1</div>
<div><strong>What is the basis risk and how is it quantified?</strong> Ask for backtesting of the trigger against actual losses.</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">2</div>
<div><strong>Who designed the trigger and what data source validates it?</strong> Ask about the measurement network, the historical record, and what happens if the data source goes offline.</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">3</div>
<div><strong>How does this product coordinate with your existing indemnity coverage?</strong> If nobody has modeled the parametric payout against your program's deductibles and sublimits, you have two unrelated products, not layered coverage.</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">4</div>
<div><strong>What happens when the trigger is not met and you have a real loss?</strong> There is no adjustment, no negotiation, and no appeals process. Know this before you sign.</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px;">
<div style="min-width: 32px; height: 32px; background: #00D4AA; border-radius: 50%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-weight: 700; color: #0A2540; font-size: 16px;">5</div>
<div><strong>How is this product classified in your jurisdiction?</strong> Insurance in some states, derivative in others, unclassified in many. Your broker should know the answer.</div>
</div>
</div>

The parametric insurance market is growing faster than the honest conversation about its limitations. That shouldn't be a reason to avoid parametric products, they solve real problems that indemnity insurance can't. But it's a reason to know what you're buying, understand its limitations, evaluate the trigger, and coordinate with your existing insurance program. Ask the questions that conference panels skip.
