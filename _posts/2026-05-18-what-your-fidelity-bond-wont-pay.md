faq:
  - question: "What does a fidelity bond not cover at a community bank?"
    answer: "A fidelity bond is not a blanket fraud policy. It is a collection of narrow insuring agreements, each with its own sublimit, conditions, and exclusions. Common gaps include social engineering sublimits that cap wire fraud recovery at $100,000 to $250,000, verification requirements that can void coverage entirely if a callback step is missed, and authorized access exclusions that deny claims when the employee who initiated the transfer had legitimate credentials."
  - question: "Does a fidelity bond cover wire fraud at a community bank?"
    answer: "It depends on the bond's social engineering endorsement. Most bonds sublimit wire fraud coverage well below the bank's typical transfer volume. A $500,000 wire fraud loss with a $250,000 sublimit means the bank absorbs the difference. If the bond also applies a co-payment, the bank's share grows further. And if the bond treats callback verification as a mandatory requirement rather than a best practice, a single missed verification step can void the claim entirely."
  - question: "What is a verification trap in a fidelity bond?"
    answer: "Most fidelity bonds require the bank to verify transfer requests through a separate communication channel before sending funds. The critical question is how the bond treats a verification failure. If verification is framed as a best practice, a missed callback reduces coverage. If it is framed as a mandatory requirement, a missed callback voids the claim entirely. One phrase in the bond determines which outcome the bank gets."

Every community bank has a fidelity bond. Most boards treat it as a checkbox: we have it, it covers fraud, next agenda item.

Your carrier may call it Financial Institution Bond, crime policy, banker's blanket bond, or just "the bond." Regardless of the name, it's the same product, and it works the same way: not as a blanket fraud policy, but as a collection of narrow insuring agreements, each with its own sublimit, conditions, and exclusions.

I've reviewed fidelity bonds for community banks and credit unions. In every one, I've found gaps the bank didn't know existed. Here are the three that matter most.

## The Sublimit That Doesn't Match the Risk

Wire fraud is the most common fraud threat to community banks, and it isn't close. Business email compromise is the costliest category of cybercrime in the country, and community banks are a primary target.

The social engineering sublimit on many fidelity bonds sits at $100,000 or $250,000. For a bank that regularly processes wire transfers in the hundreds of thousands, that sublimit can be exhausted by a single incident.

A $500,000 wire fraud loss with a $250,000 social engineering sublimit means the bank absorbs the other $250,000 out of operating income. If the bond also applies a co-payment (which [many do]({{ '/insights/the-wire-nobody-covers/' | relative_url }})), the bank's share grows even larger.

This isn't a gap hiding in fine print. It's sitting on the declarations page. Most banks have never compared the number to their wire transfer volume.

## The Verification Trap

Most bonds include a social engineering endorsement. This is a bank's main defense against wire fraud on the bond. The endorsement typically requires the bank to verify transfer requests through a separate communication channel (for example, confirming an emailed instruction by phone) before sending funds above a threshold, often $25,000.

The critical question is how the bond treats a verification failure.

<h3 style="color: #00D4AA; margin-top: 0; font-size: 18px;">Same Requirement. Different Consequences.</h3>
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 20px; margin-top: 16px;">

<div style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.85); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6;">Verification failure reduces coverage or increases the deductible. The claim is still paid, just at a lower amount.</div>
</div>
<div style="background: rgba(220,38,38,0.1); border-left: 4px solid #DC2626; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; padding: 20px;">

<div style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.85); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6;">Verification failure voids the coverage entirely. The claim is denied in full. Not reduced. Denied.</div>

<p style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 14px; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.45); line-height: 1.5;">One phrase in your bond determines which outcome you get. Most banks have never checked.</p>
</div>

When verification is framed as a mandatory requirement, the bank must prove it verified correctly for every covered transfer. One missed callback, one verification to a spoofed number, one employee who skipped the step under time pressure, and the claim is void. The whole claim, not just the amount above the threshold.

## When the Employee Did Everything Right (and the Bond Still Denies)

Here is the scenario that catches many banks off guard: an employee receives a spoofed email that appears to come from a commercial depositor requesting a wire transfer. The employee logs in with their own credentials, accesses the customer's account, and initiates the transfer. The money goes to a fraudster's account. It's gone.

The bank files a claim under the bond. The bond denies it.

Why? Because many bonds exclude losses when the person who accessed the system had legitimate credentials. The employee had authorized access. The employee used their own login. The fact that they were deceived into misusing that access doesn't matter to the bond.

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #F59E0B; padding: 16px 20px; background: rgba(245,158,11,0.05); border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; margin: 24px 0; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600; color: #333;">
The most common wire fraud scenario at a community bank is the one scenario most likely to be excluded.
</div>

Courts have sided with carriers on this. In 2020, a Virginia federal court ruled that a community bank employee who voluntarily initiated a wire transfer, even though the instruction was fraudulent, triggered the bond's voluntary parting exclusion. The employee's authority was real. The instruction was fake. The carrier didn't pay.

## What the Bond Leaves to the Cyber Policy

There are categories of loss that the fidelity bond simply doesn't address. These aren't gaps in the bond. They're outside the bond's scope entirely.

**Ransomware payments.** The bond's extortion coverage typically requires threats of bodily harm or physical damage. A $500,000 ransom demand to decrypt systems or prevent a data leak doesn't qualify. This is covered by the cyber policy's extortion or ransomware coverage, not the bond.

**Incident response costs.** Forensics, breach notification, credit monitoring, regulatory reporting, legal counsel during the 36-hour FDIC/NCUA notification window. The bond pays for stolen funds (if a trigger is met). It doesn't pay for the response. That's the cyber policy's job.

Knowing where the bond stops and the cyber policy starts matters because the two don't always line up. For a detailed look at how a single wire fraud loss can fall between both, see [The Wire Nobody Covers]({{ '/insights/the-wire-nobody-covers/' | relative_url }}). And the bond isn't the only policy with hidden conditions: [What Happens When Your Security Warranty Fails]({{ '/insights/security-warranty-fails/' | relative_url }}) shows how one lapsed control on the cyber application can void the entire policy.

## What to Check Before Your Next Renewal

If you haven't read your bond's social engineering endorsement, checked the sublimit against your wire transfer volume, or verified whether the authorized access exclusion applies to your operations, a [Risk Intelligence Report]({{ '/risk-intelligence-report/' | relative_url }}) will surface those gaps before a claim does.
